  - role: |

      I am a career changer with a long history working in the trades and service industries.  Until lately, I had always been more interested in accumulating life experiences than income.  This approach took me to some fascinating places including work on an Alaskan glacier and living in Guatemala for a couple of years.  I've gathered many great memories, gained varied skills, and learned to interact with all kinds of humans.  

      It might sound strange, but my childhood dream job was to be a mad scientist.  Seriously.

      Realistic or not, I was obsessed with the concept that I might manifest my imagination into physical form to solve problems. I'm still acquiring the necessary skills to give those ideas life, but becoming an electrician was a step in the right direction as I learned to safely work with electrical systems and everything that goes along with them.  It was extremely gratifying working with my hands to make things work.

      Before long, I discovered another way to generate problem solving devices - software development.  No longer was I stifled by the physical limitations of my strength or the cost of material parts.  I could now build virtual machines from pretty much anywhere with a computer, an Internet connection, and a little know how. Not only that, my inventions were now scalable in a way I could only dream of previously.
      
      The same ambition driving me to solve unique problems by customizing electrical systems drives me to solve them in the digital realm as well.  
      
      At my core, I seek a perpetually deeper comprehension of these systems in order to produce the best solutions all around.  I'd like to be a part of a team solving scalable problems to make the world a better place for all.  Specifically, I'd love to have a direct impact on lessening waste and streamlining energy usage for a cleaner, more sustainable natural world.  That is my goal.
